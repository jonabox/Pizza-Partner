          You are a hungry MIT student. It's late at night and none of your friends want to order with you.
          Thankfully, Pizza Partner lets you partner up with other students in your dorm so that together you can
          place an order and save money by splitting it. Pizza Partner automatically applies coupons to the combined order so that
          you can minimize your spending while maximizing your belly. ðŸ˜‰
